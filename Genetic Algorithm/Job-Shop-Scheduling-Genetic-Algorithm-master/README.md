Job Shop Scheduling Solver using Genetic Algorithm

This solver application was made for a graduation project in industrial engineering department.

The main function of this program is to get acceptable solutions in an acceptable runtime for JSSP (Job Shop Scheduling Problem) which is a problem in NP-Hard category.

The application contains a matrix data table that enables users to enter specific datas which refers to completion time of processes to create the problem. After the "RUN" button is clicked, the program starts scanning the solutions and drawing it into the chart area. It is so simple and clear to use.
